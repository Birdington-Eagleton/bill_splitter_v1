# Bill_Splitter_V1

A lightweight Python CLI tool for splitting shared bills between two users.


- Runs directly in the terminal
- Split recurring bills and subscriptions between 2 users
- Calculate special one-time expenses separately
- Confirms inputs to prevent errors and typos
- Display final result: who owes who, and how much
- Save result history for the month


**Roadmap**

Version 1.0 — CLI prototype, single file. [Completed]

Version 2.0 — Refactoring into modular structure for clarity and reusability. [*In progress*]

Version 3.0 — User Profiles & Defaults [Planned]
